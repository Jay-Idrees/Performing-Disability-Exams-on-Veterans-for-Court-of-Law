# Performing Disability Exams on Veterans for Court of Law

- The Disability exam is different from a Treatment exam in two ways

1. The purpose of the exam is not to decide a treatment, but to evaluate for disability
2. The audiance of the exam report is not medical professionals, but attorneys, judges, Rating Veterans Service Representatives or Decision Review Officers

- The RSVSR uses record from a physician and then combines with additional information from the recordsand then adjudicates a benifits claim with the schedule of rating disabilities
