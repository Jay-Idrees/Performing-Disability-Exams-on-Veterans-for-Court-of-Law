# Performing Disability Exams on Veterans for Court of Law

- The Disability exam is different from a Treatment exam in two ways

1. The purpose of the exam is not to decide a treatment, but to evaluate for disability
2. The audiance of the exam report is not medical professionals, but attorneys, judges, Rating Veterans Service Representatives or Decision Review Officers

- The RSVSR uses record from a physician and then combines with additional information from the recordsand then adjudicates a benifits claim with the schedule of rating disabilities
-  Part 4 of Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations, (38 CFR Part 4)


- **Compensation** - Monetary benifits paid to the veterans to compensate average loss of earning potential from service related conditions (conditions that occurred or were aggravated during service).

- **Pension** - Monetary benifits for war time veterans who are permanently and totaly disabled from **non-service** connected conditions or a combination of service connected and non-service connected conditions which are not a result of their own willful conduct. 


- A diagnosis must be rendered when there are findings on clinical exam. If you are unsure then you can contact the VES support staff for clarification via `1-800-994-2054` or email at [VESPhysiciansHelp@vesservices.com]( VESPhysiciansHelp@vesservices.com)


## The process

- The veteran files a claim with evidence
- The veterans benifits administration conducts an initial review of evidence if the the data is insufficient then a request for examination is sent to a Veterans Health Administration facility or to contract examintion company
- A certified C&P disability examiner then conducts assessments and completes Disability Benifit Questionares per protocol
- A Veterans Benifits Administration's Rating Veterans Service Representative or Decision Review officer including all evidence on the record including any past compensations, this is based on  [38 code Federal regulations Part 4](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/part-4)
- Then Veterans Benifits Administration notifies the service member in writing of the results


## Request for examination

- Before you perform any examination you will receive a request for examination form. The following information will be available:

```
The veteran's date of service
Priority - original if its the first exam or origin am service connection claim for a condition
```

- Normlly, a general medical exam will only be requested if
1. The veteran makes an original claim for service connection  within the designated time allowed after discharge from the service
2. If the individual claims unemployability due to service-connected conditions
3. If the veteran is claiming pension

## Types of examinations

- **Pension examination** Disease or injury that did not occur during active military service
- **Increase Examination** The veteran claims that the condition has worsened compared the last rating exam, must document time since the last examination
- **Review Examination** VA is required to periodically re-evaluate to dermine whether existing disability rating is still appropriate - detailed history should be obtained
- **Prisoner of War Examination** Approach with greatest sensitivity as these veterans have experienced a great deal of physical and physcological trauma. Examples can inlude beatings, torture, forced marches, forced labor, diet, disease, brainwashing, extremes of hot and cold, psychological abuse and anxiety
- **Terminal Examination** Exam performed on a veteran in a terminal stage
- **Inadequate Examination** When prior exam is insufficient for adjudication purposes

## Chain of appeals
- Appeal the Veteran Benifits Administration
- Board of Veteran Appeals
- US court of appeals for Veterans Claims
- US court of appeals for federal circuit
- Supreme Court

## Diaability claim Key Terms
- **Direct Service Connection**  Disability resulting from personal injury or disease contracted in line of duty - compensations maybe payed if not dishonorably discharged from service

- **Presumption of Soundness** An individual will be presumed to be sound except for defects/disorders noted at the time of entry into service, documents on an individual's DEMO general certification - it can be rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrating that an injury or disease existed prior to service

- **Aggravation by Service** When a pre-existing disability becomes permanently worse during service. Natural progression of a pre-existing condition does not qualify for this label

- **Secondary Service Connection** New disability that is connected to a pre-existing service connected disorder

- **Lay Evidence** Any evidence or statements by a person without specialized education. It can be used to describe the onset, serverity, frequency and length of time of any findings 

- **Combat Service** Legal finding of fact pertaining to injuries sustained on a battle field. The veteran will provide proof it can be accepted if the lay evidence is consistent  with the circumstances , conditions and hardships of service. The main important question is whether the current claimed injury is relatd to the combt injury. The VA claims adjudicator will have determined whether a veteran served in a combat


## Exams

- General Medical - usually sifficient for pension claims, claims for individual unemployablity, 
- Spine
- Ischemic Heart Disease
- Disability Benifits Questionare

- **Pattern of Symptoms** : `chronic headaches, cognitive difficulties, Widespread bodily pain, unexplained fatigue, chronic diarrhea, skin rashes, respirtory problems`
- Compensation & Pension Gulf War Medical Exam is a Legal and Forensic exam
[38 CFR 3.317](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2010-title38-vol1/xml/CFR-2010-title38-vol1-sec3-317.xml) is a useful legal reference to regulations regarding undiagnosed medical conditions

- The last 2 require medical nexus opinions with supporting evidence, along with an assessment whether they are related to the exposure event

- Cancer, psychiatric and cardiovascular disorders do not fall under the presumptive service connection bsed on Gulf Service

**Joint Pain**
- It is common in Gulf war- must eveluate:

1. Pain on movement that limits function - functional loss on repetitive use, flare ups

**Post Deployment Health Assessment PDHA form**
- It is a voluntary self-reporting for used to report exposure events that occurred while outside US

- There is generally a low threshold to order Gulf War General Medical Exam, if the gulf war service is verified then CFR 3.317(a)(2)(B) or 3.317(b) are used to determine whether the claim fits the listed conditions

- If there is confusion, VES support staff can be reached out at `1-800-994-2054` or [VESPhysiciansHelp@vesservices.com](VESPhysiciansHelp@vesservices.com)

- Improper documentation of diagnostic evidence must be avoided as it would lead to unnecessary delays and result in return reports

- All DBQs and examination related documents are only accessible through `VES Secure Provider Portal`. 

- Some times a patient's medical records may not be available, deemed unnecessary. That is a VA decision, not of VES

- VES will suggest the diagnostic tests that the VA generally expects for the condition to be evaluated, but you have the final authority to approve or not. You have to report the abnormal findings on tests and of exams to the veteran on the same day or during followup. The critically abnormal tests are directly communcated to the VES director

- When performing first examinations, a VES New Provider Liaison will reach out and preview upcoming examinations and associated DBQs, these are 'Exam prep sessions'

- Once fully trained you will work with a group of Quaity Analysts. Quality Analysts review all the reports before they are sent out. They cannot question the diagnosis you have rendered. 

- The Quality Analysts cannot make changes to the DBQs without the provider's approval

- The VES report should be submitted within 2 business days, and you should respont to any correspondence with in two business days.

## Writing Medical Opinions

Purpose of Medical opinions

    - Is there a link of injury to service connection
    - Determine relationships between medical conditions
    - Determine etiology
    - Reconcile diagnosis

- Clear statement regarding probability, and a well-reasoned rationale should be stated in the medical opinion
