# Performing Disability Exams on Veterans for Court of Law

- The Disability exam is different from a Treatment exam in two ways

1. The purpose of the exam is not to decide a treatment, but to evaluate for disability
2. The audiance of the exam report is not medical professionals, but attorneys, judges, Rating Veterans Service Representatives or Decision Review Officers

- The RSVSR uses record from a physician and then combines with additional information from the recordsand then adjudicates a benifits claim with the schedule of rating disabilities
-  Part 4 of Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations, (38 CFR Part 4)


- **Compensation** - Monetary benifits paid to the veterans to compensate average loss of earning potential from service related conditions.

- **Pension** - Monetary benifits for war time veterans who are permanently and totaly disabled from **non-service** connected conditions or a combination of service connected and non-service connected conditions which are not a result of their own willful conduct. 


## The process

- The veteran files a claim with evidence
- The veterans benifits administration conducts an initial review of evidence if the the data is insufficient then a request for examination is sent to a Veterans Health Administration facility or to contract examintion company
- A certified C&P disability examiner then conducts assessments and completes Disability Benifit Questionares per protocol
- A Veterans Benifits Administration's Rating Veterans Service Representative or Decision Review officer including all evidence on the record including any past compensations, this is based on  [38 code Federal regulations Part 4](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/38/part-4)
- Then Veterans Benifits Administration notifies the service member in writing of the results


## Request for examination

- Before you perform any examination you will receive a request for examination form. The following information will be available:

```
The veteran's date of service
Priority - original if its the first exam or origin am service connection claim for a condition
```

- Normlly, a general medical exam will only be requested if
1. The veteran makes an original claim for service connection  within the designated time allowed after discharge from the service
2. If the individual claims unemployability due to service-connected conditions
3. If the veteran is claiming pension

## Types of examinations

- **Pension examination** Disease or injury that did not occur during active military service
- **Increase Examination** The veteran claims that the condition has worsened compared the last rating exam, must document time since the last examination
- **Review Examination** VA is required to periodically re-evaluate to dermine whether existing disability rating is still appropriate - detailed history should be obtained
- **Prisoner of War Examination** Approach with greatest sensitivity as these veterans have experienced a great deal of physical and physcological trauma. Examples can inlude beatings, torture, forced marches, forced labor, diet, disease, brainwashing, extremes of hot and cold, psychological abuse and anxiety
- **Terminal Examination** Exam performed on a veteran in a terminal stage
- **Inadequate Examination** When prior exam is insufficient for adjudication purposes
